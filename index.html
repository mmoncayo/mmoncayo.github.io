            My name is Matt Moncayo and I've lived in Southern California my whole life. I'm originally from the city of Oxnard just South of Santa Barbara and went to UCSD for my undergrad so needless to say I've enjoyed that SoCal life.

            I work in Telecom as an RF Engineer designing and creating coverage solutions for the major carriers, and for most people, I say I'm like the guy in those commercials that says, "Can you hear me now? Good."
            I've been in San Diego for a bit over 10 years now and still enjoy every minute of it. In my downtime I like to go running and generally be outdoors. I am a big fan of IPAs and love social hangouts.

            A little fun fact about me is that I'm born on Cinco de Mayo and I'm Mexican so needless to say it's an appropriate fit to celebrate every year.
