                    Sloths are extremely slow-moving mammals found in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. There are two species of sloths:two-toed and three-toed.

                    Some sloths stay in the same tree for years. Their huge hooked claws and long arms allow them to spend most of their time hanging upside-down from trees.

                    A few unique things about sloths is that their slow movement and unique thick fur make it a great habitat for other creatures such as moths, beetles, cockroaches, fungi, and algae. 
                    In fact, this green colored algae provides a camouflage so sloths can avoid predators. Sloths can extend their tongues 10 to 12 inches out of their mouths.
